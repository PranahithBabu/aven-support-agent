Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n-"
