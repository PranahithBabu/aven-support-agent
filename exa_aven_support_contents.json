Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\n\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\n\n##### Payments\n\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card  app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments.

[https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\n\n- Can I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nCardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at [https://my.aven.com/card](https://my.aven.com/card)\n\n- Does a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nWhile a refunded purchase will reduce a customer's remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception:\n\nif there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Before You Apply\n\n- What are the eligibility criteria for applying for Aven? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

You cannot use the card until the cancellation period (also known as a rescission period) has expired.\n\nThis regulation was established by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) under U.S. federal law, and allows a borrower to cancel a home equity loan, line of credit, or refinance with a new lender, within three days of closing.\n\n- Can I apply or be eligible if my home is in a flood hazard zone? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nYes, Aven does support properties in flood zones.

In this case, Aven will work with the customer's first mortgage lender to complete a subordination agreement.\n2. Aven customer wants to payoff and close the Aven account. In this case, the Aven customer needs to submit a payoff quote request from the Aven app or online. Please note that when Aven receives the payoff request, the account will be blocked from further charges. This is done to prevent the account balance increasing beyond the payoff quote.\n\n- What happens when a house is sold? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nYour settlement agent will send Aven a payoff request.

Look up the latest rates on the [website of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates). https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\n\n\n\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system.

For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\n\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation.

An email notifying you of the form and containing a link to the document was sent out on Jan 31, 2025. You can also view and download previous year Form 1098s at the same location in your \"Documents\".\n\nBox 1 of the Form 1098 contains the total interest you paid during 2024. To be included in this Box, the interest must have been actually paid between Jan 01, 2024 and Dec 31, 2024. If you got a statement in Dec 2024 which you paid in Jan 2025, that amount will not be included in the Form 1098 for 2024.\n\nBox 2 of the Form 1098 contains the total principal that you had on Jan 01, 2024 and any additional draws or purchases you took during the year, up through Dec 31, 2024.

Balance Transfers and Cash Outs are not eligible for cashback rewards.\n\nThey can redeem points from the reward redemption page of the app. Once rewards are redeemed they will show up as statement credit. Please note - cashback rewards cannot be used to meet the minimum payment due. Cardholders need to make a payment for the minimum due. Once the minimum due has been paid, cashback rewards will count as an additional credit and will reduce the balance on the account.  [https://my.aven.com/rewards](https://my.aven.com/rewards)\n\n- How does someone close their Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf cardholders wish to close their account, a payoff letter should be sent to [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com). Once balances are paid Aven will process liens and close the account. Payments using ACH on the app can delay this process significantly, therefore, please request a payoff to [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com).\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Online Notary\n\n- Why do I need to sign a Power of Attorney (POA)? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIt is customary in real estate financing related transactions to require a borrower to sign a limited Power of Attorney (POA), which expires after 120 days of signing. This POA is only used for correcting minor typographical or grammatical errors, misspellings, or clerical errors. It specifically prohibits changes to rates, amounts.\n\n- How do notary sessions work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card is a Home Equity Line of Credit and requires document signing with a notary. Notary sessions are conducted fully online. All signers will have their own signing session. The signer needs to have their original, unexpired government issued photo ID, a mobile phone with a working video camera, microphone, and high speed internet.\n\n- Who needs to sign the agreements? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAll applicants need to sign the Account Agreement, Deed of Trust, Power of Attorney, and notice of right to cancel. All property owners and spouses need to sign the deed of trust and notice of right to cancel as a non-borrowing signer, applicable in all states as per Aven policy.

We offer it solely to provide our customers with peace of mind when using their home equity. The costs charged are passed directly through from Securian Financial, who serves as our contractual liability policy partner and our plan administrator.\n\n- I have a joint account. What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\n\n- What happens if I don’t pay the Debt Protection fee? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf you don’t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\n\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\n\n\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\n\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\n\n\n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Can't find what you need?\n\nSearch question, keywords, or

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

Took advantage of a cash out offer to lower my rate … paid all my credit cards in full and cut my the interest rate on my debt in half … it was super easy and just makes sense … got hit with a lot of unforeseen expenses this year so no choice but to pay but might as well save the interest and now just one easy payment.. thank you Aven!! 5 stars\n\n### From beginning to end - Fantastic\n\n> I was amazed how easy and fast I was able to secure a loan. Truly revolutionary in the lending process and no hassle with long waits prior to funding. I give the a 10 out of 10 in ease of operations and streamlining the lending process highly recommend. I just applied last Wednesday and the funds are on my account less than a week later including a weekend.\n\n### AVEN is the real thing.\n\n> Been with AVEN a few months now and they are delivering on all promises. Easy process to get on board, simple access to funds, robust credit limits. Way superior to complex bank HELOCs - like having a credit card simplicity with home equity back-up features. Best of both worlds.\n\n## App Privacy\n\nThe developer, Aven Financial, indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

Use the FDIC’s [BankFind](https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/bankfind) tool to discover who supervises your bank and file your complaint directly with that agency for a faster response. If your concerns involve a brokerage firm, file your complaint directly with [FINRA](https://www.finra.org/investors/need-help/file-a-complaint).Complaints involving securities, investments, or cryptocurrency should be filed with the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint).
